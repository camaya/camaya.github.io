	<p>In the past, I had thought about starting a blog, but it never was more than that, a thought. Until today.</p>
<p>Today, while I was helping a colleague with a problem, I realised that I don't really know how I got to know all I know as today.
Of course, I can name some blogs or some books, but I'm not able to create a
list of resources that anyone could use to learn what I've learnt through these
years, 6+ now, working as a developer. I'm sure there are things that you can't
learn from books, videos, or blog posts. It's experience that taught you these.</p>
<p>I keep learning every day and getting more and more experience whether it's reading a blog post, reading a book, taking a course or just working on a new project. I think it's unfair not sharing at least some of this knowledge given the blazingly amount of things I've learnt on the Internet. For this reason, I've decided that from now on I'll try to share as much information as I can. I'm sure this will help some of you, but more important than that is that it'll help my future me.</p>
<p>So, what can I write about? Nowadays at work I spend most of my time writing C#, AngularJS and working with the open source .NET CMS Umbraco and a bunch more of technologies. On my spare time, I'm always trying to keep up to date, learning new things, etc. For example, I'm taking a course on Ethical Hacking as I've been more interested in the security topic in the last months. I'm also working on a personal project which I'll tell you more about it later, for now, I'll just say that I'm finally using my favourite programming language, Python, for something else than just a simple test.</p>
<p>So, my name is Cristhian Amaya and here I'll try to share what I know with all of you.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
